## Personal Background
My name is Shantam Baidya . I am from West Bengal and currently a first-year B.Tech student pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering at the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Ranchi. I have a strong interest in Generative AI, cybersecurity, and backend development. I enjoy working on challenging problems where I can combine logical problem-solving with practical system design. The complexity and depth of a problem motivate me to explore it deeply and understand it thoroughly. And in my hobbies i am very passionate about playing guitar, i can sing song as well with playing guitar, i can play both acoustic and electric guitar but i have more experience with the acoustic one, and my other  hobby with which i am very passionate is GYM i like working out ,it refreshes my mood and i wanna build a good physique, gym helps me to stay fit both mentally and physically.My favourite food is Mutton made by my dad and rice,also there is a second choice that is biryani.I sometimes like to eat sweets and sometimes spicy, depends on my mood and cravings,specially i like rasgulla in sweets and in spicy i can go with mutton.I am going to be 20 years old in this month of may

## Family details
In my family we are a member of four,there is my father,mother, grandmother and me.My date of birth is 24th May 2006.My dream place where i would like to go with my loved ones and spent time is seychelles located in northeast of Madagascar in East Africa.

## love life
About my love life its private i cannot share a lot but i can at least say that yes i have a woman whom i love very much shes much more important to me than anyone than anything and she is my everything without her i could not have reached where i am right now , she is the reason for my every success and my happiness. She is my world.

## Educational qualifications
I have done my high schooling from Narayana School which is in West Bengal, in my class 10 boards examination i secured 96% and in the 12 boards examination i have scored 84%. I cleared the JEE Mains examination and secured a seat in the Indian Institue Of Information Technology Ranchi(IIIT)


## Technical Skills
Python is my primary programming language, and I am comfortable using it for building real-world applications. I also have basic experience with C and C++. I have hands-on experience using LangChain to build Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, including document loading, text chunking, embedding generation, and semantic retrieval. I have worked with vector databases such as FAISS for efficient similarity search.

In the field of cybersecurity, I have foundational knowledge of IP addressing, basic networking concepts, and common network protocols. I am familiar with tools like Nmap and have limited practical exposure to brute-force techniques in controlled environments. My primary interest in cybersecurity lies in Red Teaming and Bug Bounty hunting.

## Projects

### Project 1: Conversational Chatbot using LangChain and Gemini
I built a command-line conversational chatbot using LangChain and the Google Gemini (gemini-2.5-flash-lite) model. The chatbot maintains chat history using LangChain message objects, enabling contextual and multi-turn conversations. Through this project, I gained a clear understanding of how conversational agents work internally and how chat history is managed to maintain context across interactions.

### Project 2: Personal RAG Assistant
I developed a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that answers questions about my personal background using a custom document as the knowledge base. The system uses LangChain for orchestration, FAISS for vector storage, and Google Gemini as the language model. While working on this project, I learned how different document chunking strategies and retrieval techniques such as Max Marginal Relevance (MMR) directly impact the quality and relevance of generated answers.

## Learning Experience and Hackathons
I actively participate in hackathons and technical challenges, as I find them to be one of the most effective ways to learn. Working under strict time constraints pushes me to learn quickly and apply concepts in a practical setting. These experiences have helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills, improve adaptability, and gain confidence in building functional solutions rather than focusing only on theoretical knowledge.

## Interests, Preferences, and Goals
I am particularly interested in building AI systems that are practical, reliable, and useful in real-world scenarios rather than purely theoretical models. I prefer backend and system-level development over frontend-heavy work. My long-term goal is to work in a role where I can design and develop intelligent systems that solve meaningful and impactful real-world problems.In the coming future my aim is i want to build my own startup so that i can be free from this loop and life live the way i want, out from this fixed schedule of work culture. And yeah the money i generate with that i want to help others in need and once i was also in grave finacial problem so i wanna reach out and help others.Be free and provide a path to others to make them free.

## Short Reflection
Overall, I see myself as a curious and motivated learner who enjoys understanding how systems work internally. I value clean design, thoughtful engineering decisions, and continuous improvement through hands-on learning.
